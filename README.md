# Introduction 
TheCoreBlog is a very simple project that uses an ASP.Net Core 2.0 Web API as backend to store mini Blog items on a local SQL Server DB. The main idea of this project is really to rather make an introductory demonstaration of how a component-based Angular4 project can be built to consume the backend API/ how we can utilize the power of CSS grids in our Angular 4 front-end design/ how we can debug our Angular4 application using Visual Studio Code
