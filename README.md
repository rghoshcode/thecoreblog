# Introduction 
The main idea of this project is really to rather make an introductory demonstaration of how a component-based Angular4 project can be built to consume the backend API/ how we can utilize the power of CSS grids in our Angular 4 front-end design/ how we can debug our Angular4 application using Visual Studio Code.

The project uses an ASP.Net Core 2.0 Web API as backend to store mini Blog items on a local SQL Server DB. For questions or comments, please write to ranajoy121@gmail.com

# Getting Started

1.	Please install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2.	To install and use the Angular CLI as well as to run the Angular application server, we first need the Node.js JavaScript runtime and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js. Node.js can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/

3.	In order for the backend API to run on the local server, you must have Visual Studio (2015 or higher, with support for .Net Core 2.0) installed on your machine. You may then open the TCB API project with your Visual Studio and run on the local IISExpress.
